# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite, and OpenCV. It classifies both static hand signs and dynamic finger gestures using trained models.

## Features
- Real-time webcam-based gesture recognition
- Uses TFLite models for hand signs and finger gestures
- Jupyter notebooks and training data included

## How to Run
```bash
python app.py
